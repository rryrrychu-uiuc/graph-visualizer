GRAPH GRAPHICS FINAL PROJECT

My idea for a final project is the design an application that models the commonly used graph data structure using cinder 
graphical interface in order to draw graphs. The project will have three parts:
    
1. It will be able to take a given graph and display it onto a cinder window screen
    
2. It will be able to take a drawing of a graph of the cinder interface and model the actual graph using nodes
        and return a functioning graph given the model drawn on the cinder interface.
    
3. Be able to determine the approximate shortest/best path between two nodes on the graph as well some other
        properties associated with graphs like cycles, loops, and Euler circuits.

I am currently taking CS 173 and want to develop and even better understanding of one of the most fundamental data
structures in computer science. I want to be able to learn more about them by manipulating them with a visual program. I
also am extremely interested in machine learning, deep learning, and AI so getting a better grasp on heuristic problems
like shortest path will help me in the future develop.

My plan is to accomplish each one of the tasks in the numbered list within a week. That means by Week 2, I will have
almost all of the actually interface and displaying of the graphs and created graphs from the picture finished. Then
for the last week, I will use the interface to display different graph algorithms running like the determination of the
shortest path as well as detection of cycles. 

There are many things that can be done with graphs so if I finish the display of shortest path and cycles, I will try to
also add the detection of Euler circuits and the transformation of the graph into a binary tree to the project.
